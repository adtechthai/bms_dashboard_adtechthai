# Email System Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up and use the enhanced email system with SMTP configuration and delay options.

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

### 1. Database Migration
First, run the email configuration migration in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Run the contents of sql/email_config_migration.sql
-- This creates:
-- - email_config table (SMTP settings)
-- - email_logs table (email activity tracking)
-- - Proper RLS policies for security
```

### 2. Configure SMTP Settings
1. Navigate to **Admin Panel â†’ Email Config**
2. Choose a provider or enter custom SMTP settings
3. Fill in required fields:
   - SMTP Host (e.g., `smtp.gmail.com`)
   - SMTP Port (usually `587` for TLS)
   - Username (your email address)
   - Password (use App Password for Gmail)
   - From Email & Name

### 3. Test Configuration
- Click "Test Email" to verify settings work
- Check console logs for any connection issues

## ðŸ“§ Supported Email Providers

1. **Host**: `smtp.gmail.com`
2. **Port**: `587`

## ðŸ”§ Technical Features

### SMTP Integration
- **Real SMTP Sending**: Uses nodemailer with your configured SMTP server
- **HTML + Text**: Sends both HTML and plain text versions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and logging
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient connection management

### Email Logging
All email activity is logged in the `email_logs` table:
- Recipient information
- Subject and body content
- Success/failure status
- Error messages for failures
- Timestamp and admin who sent

### Security Features
- **Admin-Only Access**: Only administrators can send emails
- **Password Protection**: SMTP passwords are securely stored
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security for all email data
- **Input Validation**: All email content is validated before sending

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Email configuration not found"
- Ensure you've saved SMTP settings in Email Config page
- Check that configuration is marked as active in database

#### "SMTP Connection Failed"
- Verify SMTP host and port are correct
- Check username and password (use App Passwords for Gmail)
- Ensure firewall allows outbound connections on SMTP port

#### "Authentication Failed"
- For Gmail: Use App Password, not regular password
- For Outlook: Enable less secure apps or use App Password
- Verify username is complete email address

#### "Emails marked as spam"
- Increase delay between emails (5-10 seconds recommended)
- Verify SPF/DKIM records for your domain
- Use proper From name and email address
- Avoid spam trigger words in subject/body

### Email Provider Specific Tips

#### Gmail
- **App Passwords**: Required for 2FA-enabled accounts
- **Rate Limits**: Max ~500 emails/day for personal accounts
- **Security**: May require "Less secure app access" for some setups

#### SendGrid
- **API Key**: Use as password with username "apikey"
- **Domain Authentication**: Recommended for deliverability
- **Rate Limits**: Based on your SendGrid plan

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

### Email Logs
Monitor email activity through the database:
```sql
-- View recent email activity
SELECT 
  recipient_email,
  subject,
  status,
  sent_at,
  error_message
FROM email_logs 
ORDER BY sent_at DESC 
LIMIT 50;

-- Email success rate
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM email_logs 
WHERE sent_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY status;
```

### Performance Monitoring
- Check console logs for SMTP connection issues
- Monitor database for failed email attempts
- Track delivery rates and adjust delay settings accordingly

## ðŸš¨ Production Recommendations

### Security
1. **Environment Variables**: Store SMTP credentials in environment variables
2. **Database Encryption**: Consider encrypting SMTP passwords at rest
3. **Access Control**: Limit admin access to authorized personnel only
4. **Audit Logs**: Monitor email sending activity regularly

### Performance
1. **Batch Processing**: Use appropriate delays for large email batches
2. **Connection Pooling**: Configure nodemailer connection pooling for high volume
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse
4. **Queue System**: Consider implementing email queues for very large batches

### Deliverability
1. **Domain Authentication**: Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
2. **From Address**: Use a consistent, verified from address
3. **Content Quality**: Avoid spam trigger words and maintain good text-to-HTML ratio
4. **List Hygiene**: Regularly clean email lists and handle bounces
